# Learn-Git-Branching
In this repository, I solve challenges in https://learngitbranching.js.org and take some personal notes. Here are my notes so that you either use it as a quick-hand book or learn commands without stressing yourself in challanges üòÄ, enjoy!

## Main

### 1. Introduction to Git Commits
`git commit` : This command is the most popular git command as far as I know. With this command, you are simply logging that you made a change into the log system. You can use -m flag with a message.

```
git commit -m "Hey, this is my first commit!"
```

You can complete this challenge if you use git commit command twice.
```
git commit;
git commit;
```

### 2. Git Branches
`git branch $branchName$`  This command creates a branch so that you can do you work this path without affecting main work. You can name your branch anything you want.

`git checkout $branchName$`  This command simply SELECTS your branch. That is the purpose so that you would not make changes for another branches (such as main branch, unintentionally üòÅ).

Main thing here is when you create a branch, you are NOT going to be SELECT IT AUTOMATICALLY. If you want to checkout a branch when it is created you can use -b flag in git checkout command

```
git checkout -b MyNewBranch;
```

You can complete this challenge with the help of this flag in one line. Yikes!

```
git checkout -b bugFix;
```

### 3. Branches and Merging
`git merge $branchName$` This command merges branches. One branch is what you write its name as a parameter, and the other one is in checkout (This could be wrong irl, but in game it works in that way. If this is false, please let me know). Also, if you are going to merge two branches where one is parent and other is child, git automatically merges onto the parent.


You can complete this challenge by using these commands in order.
```
git checkout -b bugFix;
git commit;
git checkout main;
git commit;
git merge bugFix;

```

### 4. Rebase Introduction
`git rebase $branchName$` This command is also merging branches. The difference is you simply create a copy of that branch and add to the other branch's beneath. However, this command should be used carefully IRL.

You can complete this challenge by using these commands in order.
```
git checkout -b bugFix;
git commit;
git checkout main;
git commit;
git checkout bugFix;
git rebase main;
```

### 5. Moving around in Git
**HEAD** : HEAD as far as I understand, is a pointer to the node. It can be used with node's hash value. Back then, we use `git checkout` command with branch names, but in this case we use hash values of nodes. 


You can complete this challenge by using this command
`git checkout C4`


### 6. Relative Refs #1
As you experienced in Chapter 5, we use `git checkout` command with a hash value. Normally, hashes are not that simple values. For example, 5th chapter's hashcode was actually `fed2da64c0efc5243660bdd822f82b54e8cbc5d8`, or something like that you will encounter. Relative references comes in handy in such situations. Instead of typing all the hash value, you can simply use `fed2` in order to indicate the hashcode. Also do not forget, you can still use branch names. 

Now, there is a special character denoted as `^` named "caret operator". This operator provides you to make operations about one parent above of the current selected node. For example, if you type `git checkout main^`, you will checkout the first parent of main and HEAD will point that node. In that way, you do not work with hashcodes. That's great. Also, you can do operations with HEAD reference. In other words, you can travel backwards with `HEAD^`.

You can complete this challenge by using these commands.
```
git checkout bugFix^
```

### 7. Relative Refs #2
In chapter 6, Caret operator (^) was introduced. Actually, almost nothing is different in Tilde operator(~). This time, we can specify the number of how many times we want to go upwards. For example, instead of using 4 Caret operator, we can simply use "~4".


You can complete this challenge by using these commands.
```
git branch -f main C6;
git branch -f bugFix C0;
git checkout C1;
```

### 8. Reversing Changes in Git
`git reset $branchReference$`, reverses changes by moving a branch reference backwards in time to an older commit.

For example, `git reset HEAD^` goes one step back of HEAD, and acts as the last commit was never there before.

`git revert` , however, makes a new commit without applying last committed changes. In this way, your track could seem clearer.

You can complete this challenge by using these commands.
```
git reset local^
git checkout pushed
git revert HEAD
```

### 9. Moving Around Work
`git cherry-pick $commit1$ $commit2$ ...`, simply copies these commits and pastes below your current location (which is HEAD). Use the hashcode of commits as parameters.

You can complete this challenge by using these commands.
```
git cherry-pick C3 C4 C7
```

### 10. Interactive Rebase Intro
`git rebase -i $location$` , we have already learnt rebase command. The difference here is the `-i` flag. This flag allows us to select and order which commits should be rebased.

You can complete this challenge by using these commands.
```
git rebase -i HEAD^^^^
```

### 11. Locally Stacked Commits
To be honest, I did not know what to write here. I just looked the goal section and applied what is needed :D

You can complete this challenge by using these commands.
```
git checkout main
git cherry-pick C4
```

### 12. Juggling Commits
You can complete this challenge by using these commands.
```
git rebase -i caption~2 --aboveAll;
git commit --amend;
git rebase -i caption~2 --aboveAll;
git branch -f main caption;
```
### 13. Juggling Commits #2
We simply use `git cherry-pick` command instead of `git rebase -i`. Nothing different.

You can complete this challenge by using these commands.
```
git checkout main;
git cherry-pick c2;
git commit --amend;
git cherry-pick c3;
```

### 14. Git Tags
You may be asking yourself that there's a way to permanently mark historical points in your project's history. For things like major releases and big merges, is there any way to mark these commits with something more permanent than a branch? Yeap üòÄ, Git Tags are here for this issue exactly. 

`git tag $whateverYourTagIs$ $commitHash$` simply marks your commit. Do not forget that you cannot change the location of tag. Also, if you do not specify which commit is going to be tagged, git will automatically tag wherever HEAD is.

You can complete this challenge by using these commands.
```
git tag v0 C1;
git checkout C2;
git tag v1;
```

### 15. Git Describe
`git describe $commitHash$`, logs the closest position of tag. You can checkout any branch or commit, then hit `git describe` so that you can see the differences.

You can complete this challenge by using these commands.
```
git commit;
```

### 16. Rebasing Multiple Branches
`git rebase $branch1$ $branch2$`, simply takes branch2 and creates a copy, then pastes under the branch1.

You can complete this challenge by using these commands.
```
git rebase main bugFix;
git rebase bugFix side;
git rebase side another;
git rebase another main;
```

### 17. Multiple Parents
Actually, as in tilde operator, caret operator (^) also can take a number on its side. However, this number represents a parent number. See, if you have merged 2 branches and you want to go back in one of the old branches, you can determine this by caret operator with a number.

You can complete this challenge by using these commands.
```
git checkout HEAD~^2~;
git branch bugWork;
git checkout main;
```

### 18. Branch Spagetti
Oh god, here we go again.

You can complete this challenge by using these commands.
```
git checkout one;
git cherry-pick c4 c3 c2;
git checkout two;
git cherry-pick c5 c4 c3 c2;
git branch -f three c2;
```


## Remote

### 1. Clone Intro
`git clone` is used for creating local copies from a remote repository.

You can complete this challenge by using these commands.
```
git clone;
```

### 2. Remote Branches

You can complete this challenge by using these commands.
```
git commit;
git checkout o/main;
git commit;
```

### 3. Git Fetchin'

`git fetch` simply downloads remote branch commmits to our local branch system, but do not merge them.

You can complete this challenge by using these commands.
```
git fetch;
```

### 4. Git Pullin'

`git pull` on the other hand, fetchs the data and merges them in a single step.

You can complete this challenge by using these commands.
```
git pull;
```
